# CST-150 Milestone Project

UPDATE 2023/1/15
Milestone 2
Added Item Class, populated Item objects into the list box.  Finished option to add a new item with the button.  Edit item works, but I could not figure out how to re-load the edited information into the list box after it was edited.  So, instead, I made the edit item option replace the selected item instead of just editing it.  Remove item works great.  
I added exception handling if there are no items selected.  I also added a method to select the first item in the list box.


Inventory application that will contain an Item class and Inventory Class.
Item class will be used to create Item objects with a name, price, and quantity.
Inventory class will be used to create a list of, sort, search, add, remove and edit Item objects.
